# Descriptions
Tesla Coil is a team project built by UCSB IEEE members during Spring 2018. Because of my personal experience and interest in the Tesla Coil, I introduced this idea to IEEE and led our members to finish the project.

A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer, which is capable of producing high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla used these circuits to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, X-ray generation, electrotherapy, and wireless energy transmission. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters until the 1920s and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today, their primary use is for entertainment and educational displays, although small coils are still used as leak detectors for high vacuum systems.

We determined to build a Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil (DRSSTC) because itâ€™s a really good project to combine different fields together. The topics it involves include the knowledge of basic analog circuit, basic digital circuit, PCB designing and assembly, power electronics, RF circuit, etc. In the same time, students can also get the hand-on experience in building mechanical structure, 3D modeling different mechanical parts and using 3D printers, which are important and useful engineering skills.

# Parameters
- Height: about 1.8 meters (including the base)
- Resonant Frequency: about 49.5 kHz
- Bridge: CM300dy-24h H-bridge

# Results
Our DRSSTC can generate 1.3 meters long arch under 800W (80V 10A) input power, and is capable of generating music with the help of the music interrupter.
