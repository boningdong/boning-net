# Descriptions
Tesla Coil is an Android App that can provide users' safety information of different US cities. The idea of this project is from my friend Tian Gao. In this project, I was in charge of the UI/UX design of the app and the Android end development work. I built this project to learn and get familiar with Android development procedures, and this app is actually my first Android App.

You can still download this app here:
