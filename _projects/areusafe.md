Tesla Coil is an Android App that can provide users' safety information of different US cities. The idea of this project is from my friend Tian Gao. In this project, I was in charge of the UI/UX design of the app and the Android end development work. I built this project to learn and get familiar with Android development procedures, and this app is actually my first Android App. 

You can still download this app here:
