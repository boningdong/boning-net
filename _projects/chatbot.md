# Description
ChatGPT has undoubtedly revolutionized the world and introduced us to the fascinating realm of generative AI. Alongside this emerging trend, we have witnessed the rise of numerous startups exploring this field.

Driven by the desire to harness the potential of this groundbreaking technology, 2 friends and I developed a captivating 3D chatbot, offering users an immersive experience in interactive story creation. Our objective was to empower users to craft their own narratives using a combination of stories and images.

From a technical standpoint, our chatbot integrates the ChatGPT API for story creation, complemented by our own self-trained models for image generation. To construct the virtual environment, we opted for the renowned Unity game engine. Leveraging Unity's PBR shaders and post-processing capabilities, we achieved a visually satisfying aesthetic outcome. And benefiting from the flexibility of C#, we efficiently programmed both the frontend and backend logic, ensuring swift development progress.

# Goal
This project aims to achieve two main goals. Firstly, it aims to enhance my familiarity with the Unity game development process. By undertaking this project, I gained hands-on experience in various aspects, such as utilizing the Unity editor, programming in C#, working with the UI Toolkit, practicing the animations, implementing physics systems, and applying game design patterns, etc.

Secondly, this project seeks to provide me with exposure to the impressive capabilities of generative AI. Through its implementation, I was able to witness firsthand the immense power and potential of generative AI in the context of game development.

By working on this project, I strived to expand my knowledge and skills in Unity game development while also exploring the fascinating realm of generative AI.
